# Plugin Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the plugin:

## Required Icons:

1. **icon-light.png** (23x23px and 48x48px)
   - Used for light themes in Photoshop
   - Should have a dark/colored design that's visible on light backgrounds

2. **icon-dark.png** (23x23px and 48x48px)
   - Used for dark themes in Photoshop
   - Should have a light/white design that's visible on dark backgrounds

## Creating Icons:

You can create these icons using any image editor. For now, you can:

1. Create simple PNG files with the required dimensions
2. Use a solid color or simple design
3. Make sure they're recognizable at small sizes (23x23px)

## Temporary Workaround:

If you don't have icons yet, the plugin will still load but may show a default/missing icon in Photoshop's plugins panel.

To create quick placeholder icons, you can:
1. Create a 48x48px PNG with a simple shape or letter "A" for "Artistic"
2. Create a 23x23px version of the same design
3. Make a light version (dark icon) and dark version (light icon)
